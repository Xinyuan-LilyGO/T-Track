## Quick Start

The board uses USB as the JTAG upload port. When printing serial port information on USB, CDC_ON_BOOT configuration needs to be turned on. 
If the port cannot be found when uploading the program or the USB has been used for other functions, the port does not appear. 
Please enter the upload mode manually. 
-  Press and hold the BOOT button when the power is off, the button is located behind the RST button.
-  When the USB is connected, first press and hold the BOOT button, then click reset and then release the BOOT button

### Arduino

1. Inastall [Arduino 2.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. In Arduino Preferences, on the Settings tab, enter the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` URL in the `Additional boards manager URLs` input box. 
3. Click OK and the software will install. 
4. Search for ESP32 in Tools → Board Manager and install ESP32-Arduino SDK (version 2.0.3 or above)
5. Copy everything from this repository lib folder to [Arduino library folder](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries#manual-installation) (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\libraries`)
6. Select the correct settings in the Tools menu as shown below.

### PlatformIO

1. PlatformIO plug-in installation: click on the extension on the left column → search platformIO → install the first plug-in
2. Click Platforms → Embedded → search Espressif 32 in the input box → select the corresponding firmware installation

## Tips

1. When the USB is repeatedly disconnected, it means that the program is abnormal. At this time, you need to follow the steps below
   - Press and hold the **BOOT(In the middle of the trackball, press down)** button (without releasing it), then press the **RST** button, then release the **RST** button, and finally release the **BOOT(In the middle of the trackball, press down)** button
   - Click the upload button in the IDE and wait for the upload to complete
   - Press the **RST** button to exit the download mode
